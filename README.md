INTRODUCTION
------------

This module provides a field widget for modal management of referenced entities.

Go to the "Manage form display" settings of your entity and change the widget 
for any Entity reference field to "Modal widget".

NOTE: This module is in the early dev stage and as of now supports only the Edit 
operation. That means that you cannot create a new entity, you can just edit an 
existing entity. You can use the widget only for single value fields (where 
allowed number of values is limited to 1).


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the Modal Widget module as you would normally install a contributed
   Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further
   information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

There is no global configuration. You only need to configure the widget for each
Entity reference field where you want to use the Modal widget.
